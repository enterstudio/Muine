Easy:
=====

o A song information dialog (Jorn is on this)
  See http://huizen.dds.nl/~jbaayen/infodialog-proposal.html
o Fill in the gaps in the API docs
o Write a simple manual
o Proper RTL support
o Split out PlaylistWindow

Tough:
======

o Implement music groups (Jorn is working on this)
  See http://huizen.dds.nl/~jbaayen/proposal.html
o Gapless transition/crossfading
  This should be possible with the current GStreamer components, but
  it's a tough one. Well, we could emit EOS a bit earlier than usual
  and have a fancy adder somewhere in the pipeline that does the mixing
  when a new song comes in ..
o Improve first time dialog once again ..
  Perhaps a system-wide music folder gconf key, where sound-juicer dumps the
  music, and muine monitors it .. 
o Support mastroska and mp3cue

Depends on other components:
============================

o Monitor imported folders using FileWatcher
  Depends on Mono, Ximian Bugzilla #58234
o Support OGM files
  These will work once GStreamer supports them
o Fix the bug where keysyms that are assigned while muine is running aren't
  working.
  Depends on GConf#, Ximian Bugzilla #55877
o Figure out how to add new command line options (showing up in --help etc),
  and add gstreamer command line options and --start-hidden, --queue, etc
  Depends on popt support in Gtk#, Ximian Bugzilla #68889
o Make SM work fully
  Depends on popt support in Gtk#, Ximian Bugzilla #68889
o Switch metadata and playback all over to GStreamer. But, GST should
  be a bit more reliable first.
o Use Gst# when it becomes "properly available".
o Remove drop into row stuff
  Depends on Gnome Bugzilla #163129
o Fix drag-into-itself madness in add album window
  Depends on Gnome Bugzilla #163141
o Get m3u mime type icon properly
  Depends on Ximian Bugzilla #71060
o Busy-interactive cursor while loading
  Depends on Gnome Bugzilla #122728
o Fix DnD hack in PlaylistWindow
  Depends on Gnome Bugzilla #164085
o Use Hashtable/dictionary in D-Bus song info code
  Depends on Freedesktop Bugzilla #2175
o Set Window.IconName on windows
  Once we have Gtk 2.6 support in Gtk#
o Use Gtk.StatusIcon
  Once we have Gtk 2.10 support in Gtk#
o Re-enable fixed-height-mode in HandleView
  Depends on Gnome Bugzilla #165017, #165034
o Remove amazon cover fetching
  Once there is a tagger which can do this for us
o Diacritic mark-insensitive searching
  Requires .NET 2.0, see also
  http://weblogs.asp.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/19/376617.aspx

We won't have:
==============

o Internet radio support
o CD ripping
o CD playback
o CD burning
o Volume normalization. We support the replaygain tag, the tagging
  application is responsible for setting these.. Muine is purely a player.
o Visualization. Other apps can monitor the ALSA device and make fancy effects,
  for example someone could code up an xscreensaver hack.

All of these because these tasks can be handled much better by specialized
applications.
