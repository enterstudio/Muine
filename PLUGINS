Using plugins
=============

Muine will look in MUINE_PLUGIN_PATH as well as ~/.gnome2/muine/plugins for
plugins, the ones that will be found will be automatically loaded. To have
plugins loaded system-wide, put them in LIBDIR/muine/plugins.

Writing plugins
===============

Muine exports the Plugin class and the SongInterface and PlayerInterface 
interfaces through MuinePluginLib, these have more or less the same
functionality as what is exported through D-Bus. Muine installs a pkg-config
file, so compiling your plugin will be something along the lines of:

mcs -target:library -out:Plugin.dll Plugin.cs -pkg:muine-plugin

An example plugin adding Dashboard support to Muine can be found in plugins/.

If you need more functionality being exported through PluginLib to be able
to write the plugin you want, please let me know and I'll, if feasible, add
the functionality.
