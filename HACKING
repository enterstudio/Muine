Coding guidelines
-----------------
Private variable names should be written like this, e.g.
	variable_names_like_this 

Property names, and function names should be written like this, e.g.
	VariableNamesLikeThis

Spaces should be added before brackets/indexes, e.g.
	SomeFunction (arg1, arg2);
	urls [1];

Brackets should be on the same line as the statement, apart from functions, e.g.

if {
	SomeFunction ();
}

private void SomeFunction ()
{
	Foo ();
}
